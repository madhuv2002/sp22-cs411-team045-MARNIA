## Project Summary
A common problem many people face today is knowing where to watch their favorite movies. Since there are so many streaming sites like Hulu, Disney+, Netflix, Amazon Prime itâ€™s hard to keep track of where movies are. Instead of having to google where to watch a movie every time you want to watch a movie, our idea allows for users to easily search up movies and find which streaming service to use to watch it. Our website will use a Kaggle dataset to populate our website with movies from multiple streaming platforms. 

We will be using a mysql database that will store all the movie data and React for the UI. Our UI will have filter options for users to select different streaming platforms. Users will be able to also search movies to see which streaming service they are on. Users can save movies they dislike and like on our website. Movies they want to watch will be saved in their watchlist and movies they dislike which will be moved from the central database to their blacklist.
